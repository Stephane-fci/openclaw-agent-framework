## v1.0.0 — 2026-02-10

### 🟢 Initial Release

Complete framework: philosophy, workspace structure (projects/, knowledge/, meetings/), 12 slash commands (/save, /resume, /checkpoint, /progress, /help, /meeting, /idea, /task, /create, /projects, /close, /mycommands), SOUL.md additions, AGENTS.md additions, context config, credentials convention, update protocol.

**For new agents:** Read FRAMEWORK.md and implement.
**For existing agents:** Compare your setup against FRAMEWORK.md. Focus on slash commands and workspace structure — those are usually the biggest gaps.
