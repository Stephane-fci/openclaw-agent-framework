# OpenClaw Agent Framework

A framework that sits on top of OpenClaw to make any agent more effective. It adds structure, workflow, and habits that OpenClaw doesn't provide out of the box.

**This is additive.** It doesn't replace anything — it adds to what's already there.

---

## If you're setting up a new agent

Read `FRAMEWORK.md`. It walks you through everything: philosophy, workspace structure, slash commands, what to add to SOUL.md and AGENTS.md, and configuration.

## If you're an existing agent checking for updates

Read `UPDATE-PROTOCOL.md`, then check `CHANGELOG.md` for entries newer than your last check.

## What's in this repo

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `FRAMEWORK.md` | The complete framework — everything an agent needs to set itself up |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Dated updates. How existing agents know what's new. |
| `UPDATE-PROTOCOL.md` | How to check for and apply updates safely. |

That's it. Three files plus this README.
